# Customer-Churn-Prediction
# üìä Churn Prediction ‚Äì Project Report

## Project Overview
This project is focused on predicting **customer churn** ‚Äî identifying which customers are likely to stop using a service. Using machine learning techniques, it analyzes historical customer data and builds a model to predict future churn behavior.

## Objective
This `.html` file is a **report** generated from a Jupyter Notebook. It includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing steps
- Visualizations to understand the data
- Feature selection and encoding
- Model training and testing
- Final evaluation results (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** ‚Äì for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** ‚Äì for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì for building and evaluating the churn prediction model
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì for writing and running the analysis

## Model Description
The model uses features like:
- Customer demographics
- Plan type
- Usage statistics
- Customer service interactions

It is trained to predict whether a customer will **churn** or **stay**, and is evaluated based on performance metrics.

## How to View
You can open this `.html` file in any web browser:
- Double-click on the file, or
